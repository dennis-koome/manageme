This is an example of a webapp and how you can use web apps to do important stuff offline just like most of the native apps.

At first this app contains a add quote or yor notes where you can add notes and quotes offline or online and it updates in realtime.

If you add the quote it records the date and gives you the comment section where you can input all the comments or discussions regarding the quote.

If you added it offline, all the updates will be updated to other gadgets the next time you get online with the gadget you added the quote with.

All your gadgets are constantly listening for changes in your app and whenever you update or add anything they will automatically add the changes without you refreshing the page.

I also added a Timetable section where you can first configure your timetable according to your day. After configuration you can proceed to add the list of things you will do in that week on timetable items area. When you add they will automatically be added to your add items form drop down list in your add items form area.

You can now select the day and in your drop down you can see all the items you added to select. Once you click send button you will see the change on the timetable in real time and it adds the row.

You can delete the row by clicking the X or edit by clicking the Edit where you can proceed to change the items.

Below thw timetable we have the to do list. You can add a new to do list by clicking the Add ToDo Item button on the topbar. There you select the day and enter the item.
